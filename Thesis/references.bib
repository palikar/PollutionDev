abstract="The EM algorithm performs maximum likelihood estimation for data in which some variables are unobserved. We present a function that resembles negative free energy and show that the M step maximizes this function with respect to the model parameters and the E step maximizes it with respect to the distribution over the unobserved variables. From this perspective, it is easy to justify an incremental variant of the EM algorithm in which the distribution for only one of the unobserved variables is recalculated in each E step. This variant is shown empirically to give faster convergence in a mixture estimation problem. A variant of the algorithm that exploits sparse conditional distributions is also described, and a wide range of other variant algorithms are also seen to be possible.",

The algorithm uses increasing precision at successive iterations, and it moves against the direction of a generalized gradient of the computed sample performance function. Two convergence results are established: one, for the case where the expected-value function is continuously differentiable; and the other, when that function is nondifferentiable but the sample performance functions are convex. The proofs are based on a version of the uniform law of large numbers which is provable for many discrete event systems where infinitesimal perturbation analysis is known to be strongly consistent.",

 abstract = {Personal, or subjective, probabilities are used as inputs to many inferential and decision-making models, and various procedures have been developed for the elicitation of such probabilities. Included among these elicitation procedures are scoring rules, which involve the computation of a score based on the assessor's stated probabilities and on the event that actually occurs. The development of scoring rules has, in general, been restricted to the elicitation of discrete probability distributions. In this paper, families of scoring rules for the elicitation of continuous probability distributions are developed and discussed.},

abstract = {We propose a method for comparing density forecasts that is based on weighted versions of the continuous ranked probability score. The weighting emphasizes regions of interest, such as the tails or the center of a variable's range, while retaining propriety, as opposed to a recently developed weighted likelihood ratio test, which can be hedged. Threshold- and quantile-based decompositions of the continuous ranked probability score can be illustrated graphically and provide insight into the strengths and deficiencies of a forecasting method. We illustrate the use of the test and graphical tools in case studies on the Bank of England's density forecasts of quarterly inflation rates in the United Kingdom, and probabilistic predictions of wind resources in the Pacific Northwest.},
